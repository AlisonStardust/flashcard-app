# Flashcards App

Hi Brainly Team ❤️ 💡

Here you can check out my Flashcards App - recruitment task.

## Some additional comments:

* I wanted to keep it simple as possible.
Therefore I have not included any animations despite the fact that I love them! 😍
I wanted you to be able to see only the code that had been required for this task.

* I am not 100% content or happy with the code, that is why I have included some comments in files.
Despite that, I have diligently worked on the code trying to resolve the task the best way possible.

* I am not sure if I have used the BEM specification correctly, sometimes I struggle with choosing the right way using BEM. 🙈

* I have made too many commits - sorry about that!

```
I am patiently waiting for the feedback. 😊

What is more, I had so much fun working on this project.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in this recruiting process, no matter the feedback.
```

This is how the project should look like now:
